# Template: `<project-name>`

The following is an example app installation guide. For more details, please refer to the [App submission guidelines](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/extensibility/app-development/app-submission-guidelines/).

## Prerequisites

You must install or have access to the following prerequisites to develop with `<project-name>`:

- Adobe Commerce as a Cloud Service (SaaS) or Adobe Commerce version `2.4.5` or higher (PaaS).

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 22. If you have Node Version Manager (`nvm`) installed, you can run the following command to install and use the required version:

  ```bash
  nvm install 22 && nvm use
  ```

- [Adobe I/O CLI](https://developer.adobe.com/app-builder/docs/guides/runtime_guides/tools/cli-install):

  ```bash
  npm install -g @adobe/aio-cli
  ```

- Access to the [Adobe Developer Console](https://console.adobe.io/) with an App Builder license.

### Install Adobe Commerce Modules (PaaS only)

- Install the required modules for `<project-name>`:

  ```bash
  composer require magento/module-out-of-process-payment-methods --with-dependencies
  composer require magento/module-out-of-process-shipping-methods --with-dependencies
  composer require magento/module-out-of-process-tax-management --with-dependencies
  ```

- For Commerce Webhook, refer to [Install Adobe Commerce Webhooks](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/extensibility/webhooks/installation/)

- (If using Eventing) Update Commerce Eventing module to version `1.10.0` or higher:

  ```bash
  composer show magento/commerce-eventing
  composer update magento/commerce-eventing --with-dependencies
  ```

- (If using Admin UI SDK) Complete the [Admin UI SDK installation process](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/extensibility/admin-ui-sdk/installation/) and install version `3.0.0` or higher:

  ```bash
  composer require "magento/commerce-backend-sdk": ">=3.0"
  composer update magento/commerce-backend-sdk
  ```

## Initialize App Builder project

1.  Navigate to the downloaded code and run:

    ```bash
    npm install
    aio app init
    ```

1.  After selecting the organization, create or select an App Builder project during initialization. This project can be found in the [Adobe Developer Console](https://console.adobe.io/).

    ```bash
    ? Select Org: <your-ims-org>

    ? Select a Project, or press + to create new:
    ? > Do you wish to create a new Project? Yes
    Enter Project details:
    ? Name: <your-project-name>
    ? Title: <your-project-title>
    ? Description: <your-project-description>
    ```

1.  Add required services to your project:

    ```bash
    aio app add service
    ```

    Select the following from the list:

    - I/O Management API
    - (If using Eventing) I/O Events
    - (If using Eventing) Adobe I/O Events for Adobe Commerce

1.  Copy the environment variables from the `env.dist` to a local `.env` file. We will complete the required variables in the upcoming sections.

1.  Run the following command to populate the relevant `.env` values:

    ```bash
    npm run sync-oauth-credentials
    ```

    This will generate entries:

    ```env
    OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=
    OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRETS=[""]
    OAUTH_TECHNICAL_ACCOUNT_ID=
    OAUTH_TECHNICAL_ACCOUNT_EMAIL=
    OAUTH_SCOPES=[""]
    OAUTH_IMS_ORG_ID=
    ```

    - This script is also configured as a pre-app-build hook and will auto-sync when a build is triggered.

    - If the credential is empty, make sure you have added the `I/O Management API` and your `.env` is synced with the Developer Console Project as follows:

      ```bash
      aio login -f
      aio console org select
      aio console project select
      aio console workspace select
      aio app use --merge
      ```

## Connect to Adobe Commerce

Update the `COMMERCE_BASE_URL` value in the `.env` file and complete the authentication setup:

- For PaaS (On-Premise/Cloud):
  - The base URL includes your base site URL + `/rest/<store_view_code>/`
  - Example: `https://<commerce_instance_url>/rest/all/`
- For SaaS (Adobe Commerce as a Cloud Service):
  - Go to Commerce Cloud Manager in [Adobe Experience Cloud](https://experience.adobe.com/) and click info button on the instance > GraphQL endpoint URL.
  - Example: `https://na1.api.commerce.adobe.com/<tenant_id>/`

### Option 1: Authenticate with IMS

- For PaaS, this process requires a Commerce instance with [Adobe Identity Management Service (IMS) for Adobe Commerce](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-admin/start/admin/ims/adobe-ims-integration-overview.html) configured.
- For SaaS, IMS configuration is included by default.

To create OAuth credentials for App Builder authentication:

1. Access your IMS credentials via the [Adobe Developer Console](https://developer.adobe.com/console). Select the project and workspace, then click **OAuth Server-to-Server** in the side-navigation menu.

   **Note:** You can find these credentials already in your `.env` as `OAUTH_*`.

1. Add a technical account with server-to-server credentials to Commerce Admin using the [Admin User Creation Guide](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-admin/systems/user-accounts/permissions-users-all#create-a-user).

1. When associating the user, use the **Technical Account email** from the generated IMS credentials (`<technical-account>@techacct.adobe.com`) in the **Email** field.

1. On the **User Role** tab, assign the necessary API integration permissions and save the user.

### Option 2: Authenticate with Commerce Integration

1. Create a new Adobe Commerce Integration by following the [systems integration](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-admin/systems/integrations) guide.

1. Copy the integration details to the `.env` file in the root of the project.

   ```env
   COMMERCE_CONSUMER_KEY=<key>
   COMMERCE_CONSUMER_SECRET=<secret>
   COMMERCE_ACCESS_TOKEN=<access token>
   COMMERCE_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=<access token secret>
   ```

## Configuration

### Configure Payment Method

Create a payment method defined in `payment-methods.yaml`:

```bash
npm run create-payment-methods
```

Update the `.env` with your payment method code, which is used for the payment method validation webhook:

```env
COMMERCE_PAYMENT_METHOD_CODES=["<your-payment-code>"]
```

### Configure Shipping Method

Create a shipping method defined in `shipping-carriers.yaml`:

```bash
npm run create-shipping-carriers
```

### Configure Tax Integration

Create a tax integration defined in `tax-integrations.yaml`:

```bash
npm run create-tax-integrations
```

### Configure Webhooks

#### Prepare Webhook Signature

1. In Adobe Commerce, go to **Stores > Settings > Configuration > Adobe Services > Webhooks**
1. Enable **Digital Signature Configuration** and click **Regenerate Key Pair**
1. Add the generated **Public Key** to your `.env` as [the same format](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/extensibility/webhooks/signature-verification/#verify-the-signature-in-the-app-builder-action):

   ```env
   COMMERCE_WEBHOOKS_PUBLIC_KEY="-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
   XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
   -----END PUBLIC KEY-----"
   ```

#### Create Webhooks

After deploying your actions, [create the webhooks]((https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/extensibility/webhooks/create-webhooks/)) with the following App Builder actions:

_List all webhook methods and their corresponding actions required for the application._

1. `collect-taxes`: This action collects taxes for the cart.

   - For SaaS, register your action to `plugin.magento.out_of_process_tax_management.api.oop_tax_collection.collect_taxes` webhook method in **System > Webhooks > Webhooks Subscriptions**.
   - For PaaS, please refer to `webhooks.xml`. Replace the app builder URL with your action after deploying the App Builder application.

     ```xml
     <config xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
             xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="urn:magento:module:Magento_AdobeCommerceWebhooks:etc/webhooks.xsd">
         <method name="plugin.magento.out_of_process_tax_management.api.oop_tax_collection.collect_taxes" type="before">
             <hooks>
                 <batch name="collect_taxes">
                     <hook
                         name="collect_taxes"
                         url="https://<your_app_builder>.runtime.adobe.io/api/v1/web/<your-project>/collect-taxes"
                         method="POST" timeout="10000" softTimeout="2000"
                         priority="300" required="true" fallbackErrorMessage="Tax calculation failed. Please try again later."
                         ttl="0"
                     />
                 </batch>
             </hooks>
         </method>
     </config>
     ```

### Configure Eventing

Follow the steps below to configure eventing for your application:

#### Create Event Provider

Configure the event provider defined in `events.config.yaml`:

```bash
npm run configure-events
```

This scripts populates the `AIO_EVENTS_PROVIDERMETADATA_TO_PROVIDER_MAPPING` environment variable in your `.env` file with the provider metadata and the provider id.

#### Configure Commerce Eventing

To configures the Commerce event provider for your Commerce instance:

1. Update your `.env` file with the Commerce event provider metadata in **Stores > Configuration > Adobe Services > Adobe I/O Events > Commerce events**:

   ```env
   COMMERCE_ADOBE_IO_EVENTS_MERCHANT_ID=
   COMMERCE_ADOBE_IO_EVENTS_ENVIRONMENT_ID=
   ```

2. Run the following script to configure the Commerce Event module to your Commerce. This uses the commerce event provider `dx_commerce_events` defined in `events.config.yaml`:

   ```bash
   npm run configure-commerce-events
   ```

## Deploy Your Application

Once all configuration steps are complete, deploy the application:

```bash
# Deploy the application
aio app deploy -e application

# If you want to deploy the Admin UI SDK:
aio app deploy -e commerce/backend-ui/1
```

## Validation

_Write your validation steps here_

To verify the application:

1. Check that payment, shipping, and tax methods appear on the Checkout page.
1. Place an order and confirm that it is successfully created with the expected configurations.
